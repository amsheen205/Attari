  <h1><strong>My Pet Cat Mini </strong></h1>  
  <br>
  <p>My pet cat is a Persian Cat, and her name is Fluffles. My family and I named her Fluffles because of how fluffy and soft her white fur is. Sometimes, Fluffles camouflages with the carpet in my bedroom, which is also white. Fluffles really loves to sleep on that carpet, which is why we must be cautious at home so that we don’t step on her.
<br>
<p>Fluffles is always there at home for me when I come back from school. Sometimes, when I feel bad, I sit next to Fluffles and pet her soft fur, which makes me feel happy. Once, I got fewer marks than everyone in a maths test, so I felt terrible, but I went to Fluffles and played with her for a while, which made my mood better.

    It is not only my family that loves my pet cat Fluffles and me but also all my friends who come over, my cousins, etc all love to play with my pet cat. Maybe it is because she is very cute, or very fluffy, or maybe because she is a really nice pet for me and everyone else to play with. I really love Fluffles, and I hope she lives forever.</p>
